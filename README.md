## Hey there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my GitHub â€” think of it as a small tech demo!

Hereâ€™s a selection of personal projects, listed by relevance:

- **Demo** â€“ A vertical slice of a simple 2D game
- **Internal** â€“ A collection of reusable scripts I use to speed up development
- **Architecture** â€“ Implementations of various design patterns (some of which I use in my development process)

These were created for presentation, but they should give you a good feel for how I work as a developer.

Aside from coding, Iâ€™m also into **calisthenics**, **piano**, and **electronics**.

---

In my professional work, Iâ€™ve helped develop, optimize, and release:
- Metaverse for PC, Mobile, VR & Web
- Games for PC & Mobile
- Applications for Mobile
