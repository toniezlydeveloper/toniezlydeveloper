# Hey there! 👋

I keep most of my projects private, but here you’ll find a select few that might give you some insight into my work:

1.  **Demo:** A vertical slice of a simple 2D game made in Unity
    
2.  **Internal:** A collection of reusable systems for my personal Unity projects
    
3.  **Teahouse Remastered:** A game about running your own teahouse with Overcooked-like tea preparation and Sims-like room building
    

It’s not much, but I believe it’s enough.

Thanks for stopping by,  
**Cheers!**
